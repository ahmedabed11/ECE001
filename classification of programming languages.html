    <p>
        Programming languages are basically classified into two main categories – Low level language and High level language.
        However, there also exists another category known as Middle level language.
        Every programming language belongs to one of these category and sub-category.

    <h2 class="h2">Low-level language</h2>
    <p>
        The low-level language is a programming language that provides no abstraction from the hardware, and it is represented in 0 or 1 forms, which are the machine instructions.
        The languages that come under this category are the Machine level language and Assembly language.

    <h2 class="h2">High-Level Language</h2>
    <p>The high-level language is a programming language that allows a programmer to write the programs which are independent of a particular type of computer.
    The high-level languages are considered as high-level because they are closer to human languages than machine-level languages.</p>
